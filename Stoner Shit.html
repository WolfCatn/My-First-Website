                <div class="sidebar"><p>I am definitely a stoner, I love smoking weed and getting high. I mean let's be real though, who doesn't like getting high?</p>
        <p>Here are some stoner tips:</div> 
                <div class="main">
        <ul>
            <li>Always have a drink nearby for cottonmouth when smoking.</li>
            <li>There's levels to being high.</li>
            <li>Eating mangos is supposed to help boost your high.</li>
            <li>If you follow up a hit with a vape hit, it helps it not hurt as much.</li>
            <li>If you need to grind some weed, but don't have a grinder, use an empty pill bottle and a nickel.</li>
            <li>You can make a pipe from an apple or even a potato.</li>
            <li>If you spread a light coat of honey on your joints, it helps them burn slower and more evenly. </li>
            <li>If your a music lover like me, create a Spotify Stoner Mix. Music is amazing when you're high.</li>
            <li>Use a sock wrapped around a vacuum hose to pick up spilled weed, as the weed gets stuck in the sock and doesn't get sucked into the vacuum.</li>
            <li>Smoke before you eat, food will taste better.</li>
            <li>If you use frozen fruit in your bong water, it gives it flavor.</li>
            <li>You can use pipe cleaners to clean your pipes. </li>
            <li>Just superglue a magnet to your bong, and then you can have your lighter attached to your bong.</li>
            <li>If you need to hide weed, hide it in the bottom of a deodorant container.</li>
            <li>Use a paper towel roll and dryer sheets to hide the scent of the weed smoke. Put the dryer sheets in the roll and blow through it.</li>
            <li>You can use scissors instead of a grinder</li>
            <li>Have a stoner kit for after smoking. Make sure to have eye drops, sunglasses, a drink, and mints/gum.</li>
            <li>Do not go to the store high, you will probably overspend.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy watching shows while stoned, prepick the show so when you're high you don't have to worry about picking a show.</li>
            <li>Know the strain and how it affects you. Some strains are more energizing, while others are more relaxing.</li>
        </ul>
