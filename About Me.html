            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <body>
                <p>Hey there! My name is Nigh. I am 17 years old, and a senior in high school. 
                I am a middle child. I have 5 brothers, 3 older and 2 younger; I also have a sister who's older than me.</p>
                <p>I have many passions, things I like to do; 
                but most recently, I've found myself doing a lot of the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cooking</li>
                    <li>Reading</li>
                    <li>Listening to music</li>
                    <li>Playing D&D</li>
                    <li>Scrolling through Pinterest</li>
                    <li>Playing Minecraft</li>
                    <li>Tennis</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                My favorite type of music is alternative rock. 
                However, I will sometimes listen to a wide variety of music.
                The main types of music I won't listen to and don't really like is country, jazz, and blues. 
                Some country is okay, but not most of it to me.
                </p>
                <p>Now to answer a common question people have: what do you want to do when you're older?
                    For me the answer is go to college, get my degree, and work in a field I love. 
                    As of right now, I applied for the criminology major at the University of Idaho and got accepted. 
                    That will be my primary choice. I found out I love criminology when I took my first forensic science class my sophmore year.
                    However, if that doesn't work out or becomes too much for me to handle, I have another option.
                    I also want to major or at least minor in psychology. 
                    I think it'd be cool, if I don't go into criminology, to become a social worker.
                </p>
                <p>Why you might ask? Because of the way social workers have changed my life. 
                    Last year during my junior year of high school, I was really struggling with my mental health.
                    It got so bad that I had to go inpatient. I ended up going to EIRMC BHC twice. 
                    The first time, I had an amazing therapist. He really helped me. When I went in the second time, it was my doctor that was amazing.
                    The nurses and psych techs there both times were amazing. They all really helped me so much. 
                    After my second time there, I got sent to a residential. My therapist there was a social worker. 
                    She changed my life. She helped me not only find the will to live, but the will to thrive. 
                    She helped me see that things may be hard, but I could get through it; that I may feel trapped, but there was a way out.
                    I wasn't the nicest to her and I was pretty non-compliant when I first got there. 
                    However; she stuck through it and never gave up on me, as everyone else in my life at the time had, including my family.
                    This is why I think it'd be cool to become a social worker. I want to help change kids' life who are struggling with mental health the way my therapists did.
