        <title>Side Quests</title>
        <p>I have been on many epic side quests in my life. Most of them are from the summer and fall after I turned 18.
            I love exploring and going on adventures. I love being in nature, and I also love exploring abandoned places.</p>

        <p>I think my favorite one was one of the first ones I ever went on. It was with my best friend, which made it all the better.
            We went to The Ledge, which is a small cliff that you can jump off of into the river. It was in the spring when there was still snow and mud everywhere.
            We had to walk because the car got stuck in the mud. The water was freezing, but it was epic. And on the walk back we kept joking about how we wouldn't mind getting kidnapped because we were so cold on the walk back.
            His sister ended up coming and drove us back and got my car out of the mud, which was amazing. Then we tried to get high, my bestie succeeded, but for some reason it just didn't work for me.
            When he told his mom the story all she said was, "You guys have no survival instinct!" That whole day was definitely epic.
        </p>
        <p>Another memoriable quest was when I went with a couple friends and we hiked to under the Perrine Bridge. We got pretty baked. We then climbed up the cliff and the 3 levels of platforms to reach the catwalk.
            It was a little scary, but the view and everything was amazing. When we got to the first platform, we smoked a blunt before climbing the ladders to the top platform where the catwalk was.
            We also smoked a fat blunt on the top platform. The first time we went there, my friend walked across a lot of the catwalk. 
            I never actually went more than a few steps on the catwalk, but it was still epic. The climb up was definitely the most intense part, as the loose rocks and bushes made it pretty difficult.
            It was definitely worth it though, the view was amazing, even though it was dark, and it was a really fun adventure. The picture below shows the catwalk.

        <p>There's a frequent abandoned place I go to a lot. It's called suicide swing. It's where an old tire swing on top of a very, very old oil refinery that has been long abandoned. 
            It's also on the edge of a cliff, which is where it's gets the name "suicide swing".

        <p>The place I've been most has to be the abandoned fish hatchery. Me and my friends went there all the time in the fall.
            I also love going alone. It's a really chill spot, honestly. I didn't get many pictures of the abandoned fish hatchery itself, moreso just the abandoned house next to it.
            I also have several pictures and videos of some epic fires my friends and I made.
